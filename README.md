# hooverZoom
Firefox add-on (via Mozilla SDK) for displaying image link targets in a popup panel.

Initial release will be fairly basic, popup a window for any A tag with an HREF pointing at an image.

Will include special-case support for imgur.com to load albums and scroll-wheel between photos, similar to the Hover Zoom add-on for Chrome, and loading MP4 video versions of animaed GIF (smaller, faster, better).
