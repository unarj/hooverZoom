# hooverZoom
Firefox add-on (via Mozilla SDK) for displaying image link targets in a popup panel.

Initial release will be fairly basic, popup a window for any A tag with an HREF pointing at an image.

Will include special-case support for imgur.com to load albumbs and scroll-wheel between photos, similar to the Hover Zoom add-on for Chrome.  No Firefox add-on has similar functionality as of yet.

Hover Zoom was my inspiration for begining this journey.
